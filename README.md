# Tango_CUDA
An example app for the Project Tango device that utilizes CUDA for computation.
Can be used for other Android devices that support CUDA, such as the NVIDIA Shield Tablet and Xiaomi Mi Pad. The Shield Tablet supports CUDA 7.0, which would require a few changes to the NVCC command-line invocation.

Note: Some paths in build.gradle and Android.mk will need to be modified to match your system.
